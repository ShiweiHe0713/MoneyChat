# MoneyChat üíµ ü§ñÔ∏è

## Background
This is a project I plan to finish during the [Out In Tech](https://outintech.com/) Mentorship program (4/11-6/13, 2024), under the guidance of Raika Dail (Huge thanks to Raika!! ü•∞)

- **What is MoneyChat?**
MoneyChat is a chatbot that helps you manage your money. It is built using the GPT and the Banks API(BOA, Chase) <br><br>

- **What inspired MoneyChat?**
I am a broke college student and I found my bank's app to be very confusing and not very accessible. I wanted to create a chatbot that would help me manage my money in a more user-friendly way.

## Objectives
- **What can MoneyChat do?**
A ChatBot that's connected with customers' bank account and provide them with information and visualization about their transactions. It can also help customers refine their budget and provide them with financial advice.
<br><br>
- **Why is it helpful?**
Finance for outsiders can be confusing, and the traditional way of interacting with website or app charts is not the future. Chatting with an AI that knows everything about your finance, MoneyChat will be like a personal finance assistant/doctor, keep clients finance condition healthy.

### Some use case scenarios
**"Hey, MoneyChat!"**

1. "What's my last month's overall expenses like? Rank each category by expenses, and draw me a pie chart."<br><br>

2. "According to my last 6 months' expense, make me an achievable yet economical budget plan for this month."<br><br>

3. "What is my fixed bills every month? And what is the total amount of my fixed expense?"<br><br>

4. "Based on my last 3 months' cash flow, give me some advice on improving my finance."<br><br>

5. "Have I defaulted on any my credit card dues? Give me my credit card activities for every month."<br><br>

## Scope 
### Ene Goal of the Product
- A knowledgeable Finance Chatbot who knows a lot about personal finance and finance in general.
- Backend connect to Third-party banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.
- A neat, beautiful and interactive website to interact with using automatic front-end techniques like Streamlit.

### Mimimum Viable Product
- A ChatBot that can chat based on our monthly bank's statements(Since Bank's API may not be accessible for me.)

### Stretching Goals
1. Building the wesbite's UI using **React.js**
2. Adding **dashboards** to display clients' most common viewed graphs or data.(Sort of like Tableau baords)
3. Building an **IOS** App and release on App Store
